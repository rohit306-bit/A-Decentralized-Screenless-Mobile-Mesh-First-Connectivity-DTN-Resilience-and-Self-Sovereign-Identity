\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the design of a decentralized, screenless mobile device that prioritizes proximity mesh links (Wi-Fi Aware/NAN), efficient voice transport (Bluetooth LE Audio/LC3), and long-range, low-power links (LoRa) with Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) for store-and-forward, secured end-to-end with decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Matrix-style cryptography. Inspired by mesh telephony deployments (Serval, Village Telco) and recent screenless assistants, the architecture addresses usability and resilience via local-first design, E2E encryption, and opportunistic federation. We detail hardware/software stack, interaction model, security, energy considerations, and an evaluation plan, and include implementable diagrams suitable for IEEE figures.

\section{Introduction}
Screenless wearables illustrate the promise of voice-first mobility and the pitfalls of cloud dependence, motivating a local-first, decentralized rethink of the ``phone'' without a display. Community mesh telephony projects (Serval, Village Telco) demonstrated infrastructure-free calling and messaging in disasters and underserved regions using ad-hoc Wi-Fi and mesh relays. DTN and decentralized identity complete the resilience and trust story by enabling eventual delivery across disruptions and portable authentication without centralized accounts.

\section{Background and Related Work}
\subsection{Mesh telephony and Serval / Village Telco}
Serval integrated device-to-device calling over Wi-Fi with store-and-forward (Rhizome) and mesh extenders. Village Telco validated VoIP over community WLAN mesh with satisfactory QoS and adoption metrics.

\subsection{Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN)}
DTN's Bundle Protocol decouples endpoints in space and time and supports store-and-forward across intermittent links.

\subsection{Decentralized Identity and Matrix}
W3C DIDs enable self-sovereign identifiers and verifiable credentials; Matrix provides decentralized, federated, end-to-end encrypted messaging suited for opportunistic federation when IP is available.

\section{System Goals}
The system goals are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Connectivity independent of infrastructure (mesh first).
  \item Graceful degradation under disruption (DTN store-and-forward).
  \item Privacy-preserving identity and messaging without centralized accounts (DIDs + Matrix).
  \item Audio/haptic-first interaction (LE Audio/LC3 for low bitrate voice).
  \item Modular radios and low energy footprint by omitting a display.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Architecture}
\subsection{Hardware}
An always-on low-power MCU handles wake-word and sensor gating; an application SoC runs networking and inference. Audio I/O includes far-field microphones and speaker or bone conduction; haptics provide private feedback. Radios: Wi-Fi Aware (NAN), BLE (LE Audio / LC3), and LoRa for sparse backhaul.

\subsection{Software and Protocol Stack}
Proximity discovery uses Wi-Fi Aware/NAN; when IP is present Matrix-style E2E messaging is used; DTN bundles provide store-and-forward spanning LoRa and other intermittent links. Identity and authentication rely on DIDs with signed DID Documents.

\section{Interaction Model}
The device is voice/haptics-first: wake-word, spoken confirmations, and tactile cues. LE Audio/LC3 improves intelligibility at low bitrates, lowering airtime and power. Non-visual controls use tactile patterns for discreet notifications and mode switching. Context disambiguation leverages wearable HCI techniques for audio-only outputs.

\section{Security and Privacy}
Identity and trust are anchored in W3C DIDs with signed DID Documents and verifiable credentials; peers verify control and rotate keys without centralized registries. For messaging over IP, Matrix federation with E2E encryption prevents intermediaries from reading content while allowing self-hosted homeservers. Hardware privacy controls include physical mic mute and capture-LED transparency.

\section{Mode State Machine}
Prefer mesh (Wi-Fi Aware) for discovery and low-latency sessions; use federated IP via Matrix when reachable; fall back to DTN bundles over LoRa and queue for recontact. Reconciliation happens on recontact.

\end{tikzpicture}%
}
\caption{Mode state transitions (compact).}

\end{figure}

\section{Energy Considerations}
Displays dominate smartphone power in many modes; omitting the display improves endurance. LE Audio/LC3 reduces bitrate for comparable quality and improves packet loss resilience, lowering radio duty cycle. Opportunistic DTN transfers on LoRa shift background sync to ultra-low-throughput windows, with ADR balancing reliability and energy.

\section{Proposed Solutions}
\subsection{Mesh-First Communication}
Default to Wi-Fi Aware proximity sessions for discovery, signalling and data; form clusters that maintain calling/messaging functionality without APs.

\subsection{DTN Store-and-Forward}
Use Bundle Protocol overlay to queue and relay messages and voice snippets across partitions ensuring eventual delivery.

\subsection{Sovereign Identity \& E2E}
Adopt DIDs for authentication and Matrix E2E for confidentiality in federated modes to avoid centralized account dependency.

\section{Implementation Plan}
\textbf{Phase 1:} Android-class prototype using Wi-Fi Aware APIs, BLE/LE Audio and external LoRa for DTN validation.  
\textbf{Phase 2:} Integrate DID libraries and Matrix clients for peer auth, E2E messaging and optional federation.  
\textbf{Phase 3:} Field trials mirroring Serval/Village Telco community meshes and disaster exercises.

\section{Evaluation Methodology}
Connectivity: delivery ratio, time-to-deliver, path diversity under induced disruptions comparing mesh-only, DTN-over-mesh, and federated modes.  
Energy: standby and active power with/without voice sessions; quantify savings from eliminating displays and adopting LC3.  
Usability: task completion, error rates, and subjective workload for voice/haptic tasks.

\section{Limitations}
LoRa’s low rate constrains rich media and mandates prioritization of signaling, text and compressed summaries. Wi-Fi Aware support varies by chipset and OEM. Screenless interactions face discoverability challenges.

\section{Future Work}
On-device speech and compact edge LLMs for offline NLU/NLG; multi-radio policy learning to select among radios based on context; community deployment toolkits and governance models.

\section{Conclusion}
Combining mesh-first Wi-Fi Aware, DTN, and sovereign identity with Matrix E2E and a voice/haptics interaction model enables a decentralized, screenless mobile that preserves privacy, degrades gracefully, and improves energy endurance by omitting the display.
